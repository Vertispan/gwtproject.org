 [ ] Publish on gwt-contrib mailing list that we have switched, and propose the
     new repo be adopted into github.com/gwtproject
 [ ] Migrate gwt-site-webapp to github
 [ ] Reduce gwt-site-webapp to _just_ the JS output, so it doesn't rely on gwt-site
 [ ] Update gwt-site-webapp to support Java 11, GWT 2.9.0
 [ ] Set up CI to produce artifacts for gwt-site, gwt-site-webapp
 [ ] Update this repository to use those artifacts instead of building from scratch
